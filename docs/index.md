## Project Overview

I want to preface this overview produced is not very in depth as I intend to discuss the results of the project further in the interview. I intend for the entirety of this writeup to be light to cover the interesting findings and general approach made throughout the project.

For this interview project, I wanted to focus on implementing two different datasets. One dataset contains transcripts from doctors and the specialization that that the doctor is within. These entries are made up of large chunks of text requiring natural language processing to interpret and classify the output. This would give me the opportunity to train a model off these transcripts and have it classify the specialty these transcripts were produced under. I found another dataset that is composed of many different features to make up a patient and the medical costs that they received. I could leverage this dataset to design classification and regression models related to the charges incurred on the patient.

I thought both datasets can be a great exploration into demonstrating my approach towards a classical machine learning problem as well as a foray into more advanced dataset of interpreting and classifying text. I created two sections for this website demonstrating my findings and quantitative results for each dataset. The first is for the traditional classification and regression models built for insurance cost dataset and second is for the RNN and BERT models created for the medical transcripts and specialties dataset. I will dive much deeper into how I approach each dataset within these respective sections, these can be selected from the top navigation bar.
